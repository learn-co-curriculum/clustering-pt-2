# clustering-pt-2

The math behind k-means clustering (part II)
- Disadvantages of EM + illustrate
- Can be slow
- End result strongly dependent on initial guess of clusters centersâ†’ local maxima instead of global maxima (illustrate)
- Amount k has to be decided beforehand
- Linear method - performs poorly for particular cluster shapes

More complicated clustering techniques
- Use gaussian mixture models
- Use clustering techniques that can chose the number k for you
- Kernelized k-means for weird cluster shapes
